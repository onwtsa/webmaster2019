	  <p> The Engineering Academy is one of the many 4-year 21st century programs in the Olathe School District. Freshman through junior year, students in this program are taught basic engineering skills, and take science classes that are engineering focused. Senior year students choose a Capstone class / project to work on. These include Engineer a Better World, Future Tech Challenge, Team 1710 Robotics, Electrathon, and / or Internship.

	<ul>
	<li> Freshman: <br /> Freshmen take take Intro to Engineering and Honors Biology. This introductory engineering course teaches students the basics of engineering design, while the honors biology class Taylor science to real-world problems in applications. Both classes include Hands-On projects, like designing and rutf, building a tower to withstand an earthquake, and designing an aerial camera. through these classes, students get an overview of the field and are introduced to the various careers within the field of engineering.
	</li>
	<li> Sophmore: <br /> Students in their sophomore year take CAD 1 and 2 and Honors Chemistry. Students in these classes learn about manual and computer aided drafting. In both 2D and 3D over the course of the year. In honors chemistry, there is an engineering focus, as students learn in depth about the interactions between and property of matter these classes come together in the third quarter when students design and forge their own rings out of sterling silver.
</li>
	<li> Junior: <br /> In junior year of this program the students learn engineering Robotics and AP Physics. The junior year focuses on mechanical, electrical, and materials engineering through engineering robotics in AP Physics. And this robotics course students work to a design project, exploring basic computer programming and sensor data in addition to technical communication skills. This pairs with knowledge gained from the AP Physics course with an engineering Focus, converting a curriculum of a first-year college Physics course. This includes, Newtonian Mechanics, Work, Energy Power, electric circuits, and more.</li>
	<li> Senior: <br /> To  finish off with the engineering program students participate in a Capstone. students use the skills and knowledge gained at the Academy to conduct a project of practical use, in addition to capstone's available at the school, students have the opportunity to apply for internship credits.
 </li>
